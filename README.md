# TREFLOYNE
#### Video Demo: 
#### Description: I have created a web application to help me keep track of my golf statistics when playing at my local course. It was fairly easy to decide to attempt creating this as I play copious amounts of golf, with a keen interest on keeping my stats from each round. My web app uses python with the Django framework, with help from various other sources such as bootstrap, crispyforms and plotly. The idea was that after a round of golf, I would be able enter certain data from my round into the web app, and it would keep a track of these, displaying these statistics to see if there were any areas of my golf game that might need improving more than others. Originally I intended to keep this project for my own personal use only, however, after mentioning it to some friends of mine with whom I play golf, it was pretty clear that they would also like to be able to use it. This meant making adding user registration and login/logout functionality. I created this project on my own personal version of Visual Studio Code, and made regular pushes to GitHub.

#### Description: Django auto-generates a project folder and sub-folders with certain app-specific files and settings, and database configuration. The project root directory contains numerous folders, one automatically created is called 'Trefloyne' which is the name of my application, within this folder is the file 'settings.py' which contains all of the settings which link throughout my project, some of these settings have been updated throughout development. 'urls.py' defines the list of URL routes, the other files in this folder are auto-generated and are uneditted by myself. Some files are loose within the root directory, the auto-generated database 'db.sqlite3' is where all of the user data is stored, including user info and round entries. The 'requirements.txt' file contains a list of neccessary downloads should someone wish to run my application, this list was regularly updated. 'manage.py' offers command-line utility to complete administrator tasks and points towards the 'settings.py' file. There is a file titled '.env' which I created after adding email functionality to the web app. New users will be emailed a welcome email, to do this I had to add my email credentials into the 'settings.py' file which is in plain text. Alternatively, I created the '.env' file to store the credentials and linked to this file, this keeps the sensitive information more secure. '.gitignore' 

#### Description: The folder where most of my programming has been done is titled 'stats', this includes 'urls.py' which simply defines the path to each html page within the webapp. 'models.py' defines what will be entered and stored in the database when the user submits the form, I created one model for each round submitted, and one model for each hole in the round. These were linked together using a ForiegnKey. I had to decide which fields to add to my models, and they were updated occassionally to encorporate new ideas. Originally for the RoundModel I had date, tees, score, fairway, green, putts as the fields, this ended up also including course name, 18 or 9 holes, front or back 9 holes, and user. This allowed for greater functionality and increased the overall statistics that could be generated. Possibly the most important file is 'views.py', here I have defined each function related to a URL. What happens when each page is visited and forms submitted can be seen here, for examply the login and register functions, as well as the main index page. Numerous libraries are in use on this page, and each form and model from the app is imported to be used within the views. The 'forms.py'
